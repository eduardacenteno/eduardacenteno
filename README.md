#### B.Sc in Biotechnology, M.S.c in Neuroscience (Neuramus Programme - Université de Bordeaux & Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam) with +6 years of experience in research in different areas such as electrophysiology, cell culture, molecular biology, cell biology, animal models, brain dissection. I now focus on computational neuroscience and open science. 

#### I currently work as a part-time Research Assistant at the Vrije Universiteit Medical Center (VUmc Amsterdam - Netherlands), and I'm also a PhD student in Neuroscience at the Université de Bordeaux (Bordeaux Neurocampus - France). As an RA, I work mainly with implementing Open Science tools (including GitHub) to improve the accessibility, findability, and reuse of the [MULTINET LAB](https://github.com/multinetlab-amsterdam) scripts, pipelines, and eventually data. As a PhD student, I investigate the underlying neural mechanisms of song production in songbirds (zebra finches), trying to uncover the potential role of high-frequency oscillations in the song system circuitry. A major part of my project is to develop/contribute to/work with open-source Python tools (e.g., [neo](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/python-neo), [elephant](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/elephant), [odmltables](https://github.com/INM-6/python-odmltables)). The [E4-IMN team](https://github.com/IMN-E4) is also migrating to GitHub, where we'll make available our data analysis pipelines.
